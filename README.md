CFB PBP analysis/Team Rankings

I created this stream of analyses based off of other's I saw doing similar work within the space and then morphed it into areas I wanted to explore. Definitely check out @statsowar on Twitter if you have similar interest and like me have no idea where to start. He provied much of the initial code to get the play-by-play data. Additionally, I leveraged @cfbscrapR on Twitter to get going on the data side.

I also try to mimic Bill Connelly, and find a more predicitve ranking for college football teams. This is something I am still working on - especially with opponent adjustments!
